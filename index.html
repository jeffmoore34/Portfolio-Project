        About Me
        </h1>
            <p>
                Currently, I am on my journey to becoming a Full-Stack Developer!  I recent got married in 2023 and had my first-born daughter in mid 2024.  It's been an exciiting time to say the least!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before all of that, I was lucky enough to be in a small band during college and tour (most) of the country.  After I realized I needed something more stable, and accepted the "dream" was dead, I set my focus on what was next. <br> I went into Sales for a few years before tranitioning into a Customer Success role,
                and ultimately where I'm at now, which is on the Software Implementation side of things.
            </p>

                Now, you may be asking, "Why do you want to be a Engineer/Developer?"  That's a legit question!  Here's why.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>First of all, I <span>MISSED</span> being creative</li>
                    <li>I love puzzles and my mind has always worked in an Analytical fashion</li>
                    <li>To make a better life for myself and my litte family</li>
                    <li>Having the ability to build something from nothing</li>
                </ul>
